# kidwar - samples I - monotron
This is the source code of the album released on [Exiles](https://exiles-electronics.bandcamp.com/) that extensively and only uses samples recorded from a **Korg Monotron Delay**, coded in [TidalCycles](https://www.tidalcycles.org), a live coding environment nested in the programming languate Haskell for music and pattern generation.
To use this code, [you have to install the TidalCycles environment](https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/Installation) on your desktop. You can play around, tweak it and check out what is going on, record your own stuff based on this, etc (if you extend your SuperDirt samples as mentioned below).

#### Extended functions
These tracks / files only use one extra function called `m` for muting (basically it mutes a code block by completeley degrading it), this can be found in the `func.tidal`. If you do not want to have error messages, just run this line before you start tweaking around in the actual music. If you do not want to run it every time before you start tweaking around, you can wrap it up in your `BootTidal.hs`, for further info on this, please read the official TidalCycles documentation.

### [Korg Monotron Delay samples](https://archive.org/details/kidwar-monotron-ep-samples)
By extending your SuperDirt samples folder with the samples recorded from one single Korg Monotron Delay, you can play any of the files and reproduce the music and tweak around.
[The samples can be downloaded from here](https://archive.org/details/kidwar-monotron-ep-samples) and are completely free for any kind of usage with no rights reserved.
